### Info
* Displays recommendations upon page loading
* Pulls rating from IMDB and displays on bottom of movie card
* Search function displays other relevant movies

### Issues
* 1 day prior to due date, discovered OTT-Details API, and original IMDB scraper were down. 
* Worked to set up a new IMDB API, to retrieve data and rating at the minimum. 
* We kept all the code for OTT-Details and original IMDB scraper in the script.js file, but commented out. At the time of due date, those API's were still down. 
* Favorites page/Local Storage is WIP. Upon failure of the API's, priority was to set up at least one new API so search function and movie cards were operational.
