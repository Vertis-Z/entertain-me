                  When monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju, started rising from the sea, a war began that would take
                  millions of lives and consume humanity's resources for years on end. To combat the giant Kaiju, a
                  special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled
                  simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are
                  proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces
                  defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes - a washed up former pilot
                  (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) - who are teamed to drive a legendary but
                  seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the
                  mounting apocalypse

                  hunter John Ruth and his fugitive captive Daisy Domergue race towards the town of Red Rock, where Ruth
                  will bring Daisy to justice. Along the road, they encounter Major Marquis Warren (an infamous bounty

                  Bob, who claims to be taking care of the place while Minnie is gone; Oswaldo Mobray, the hangman of
                  Red Rock; Joe Gage, a cow puncher; and confederate general Sanford Smithers. As the storm overtakes

                  Thomas A. Anderson is a man living two lives. By day he is an average computer programmer and by night
                  a hacker known as Neo. Neo has always questioned his reality, but the truth is far beyond his
                  imagination. Neo finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus, a legendary
                  computer hacker branded a terrorist by the government. As a rebel against the machines, Neo must
                  confront the agents: super-powerful computer programs devoted to stopping Neo and the entire human
                  rebellion.

                  dismay. On the way to their new home, Chihiro's father makes a wrong turn and drives down a lonely
                  one-lane road which dead-ends in front of a tunnel. Her parents decide to stop the car and explore the

                  little town. When her parents see a restaurant with great-smelling food but no staff, they decide to
                  eat and pay later. However, Chihiro refuses to eat and decides to explore the theme park a bit more.
                  She meets a boy named Haku who tells her that Chihiro and her parents are in danger, and they must
                  leave immediately. She runs to the restaurant and finds that her parents have turned into pigs. In
                  addition, the theme park turns out to be a town inhabited by demons, spirits, and evil gods. At the
                  center of the town is a bathhouse where these creatures go to relax. The owner of the bathhouse is the
                  evil witch Yubaba, who is intent on keeping all trespassers as captive workers, including Chihiro.
                  Chihiro must rely on Haku to save her parents in hopes of returning to their world.
